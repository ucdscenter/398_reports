2005,WBQC,UPN,Cincinnati,3,Analog,THE TRIBE,Core,Syndicated,SAT/9:00AM,13,0,30,1,16,"Form 398 asks each station to ""describe the educational and informational objectives of the program and how it meets the definition of Core Programming."" The FCC defines ""core programming"" as programming that is specifically designed to serve the educational and informational needs of children ages 16 and under. THE TRIBE was co-created by Harry Duffin, a full time school teacher for 15 years prior to writing full time for THE TRIBE. Before production began on the first season of THE TRIBE, focus groups were done by the producers, Cloud 9 Entertainment and also the original broadcaster of the series, Channel FIVE in the UK. The purpose of these focus groups was to make sure that the issues important to children were interwoven into each storyline. The format for the series was written from an educational point-of-view. As the series developed Cloud 9 Entertainment put a full time school liaison officer on their board. Cloud 9 is continually in touch with schools around the world and prior to writing each season they canvas these schools and teachers to stay up-to-date on issues facing our children in the world today. Teachers around the world are also involved in writing articles for THE TRIBE website. The themes range from social democracy to the responsibility of technology and even tie in historical references. Two books have been written about THE TRIBE which are actually studied in school and are published by Learning Media (an educational publisher). If you go to www.tribewold.com and click on the ""archives"" section you will see why this website is considered to be a teacher's aid and supports schools around the world who are studying THE TRIBE, let alone the individual child who has found various articles of interest to read. Cloud 9 views their website as a ""global classroom"" and even a visit to the bulletin board is an interesting aspect displaying children communicating with each other across various cultures (ie Germany to Norway, UK to the USA). Their discussion about current affairs is fascinating and provides teachers with interesting feedback. There are many ways to reach children today that will teach them about life. Watching an imaginative show like THE TRIBE enables them to learn life lessons in an unconventional but important way. Cloud 9 is associated with several charities around the world including UNICEF and their own Cloud 9 Children's Foundation. The following letter from an anthropologist eloquently sums up the social development educational aspects of The Tribe. He writes: I am a 54 y.o. anthropologist and archaeologist who absolutely loves the Tribe. I have always been fascinated by post-apocalyptic story-lines. The Tribe is an especially good example of that genre because it has an entire segment o f society wiped out, but rather than racial, socio-political or even gender related, the Tribe has based it's cataclysm on age. The interplay between ""good/evil"" is enhanced by the tribal divisions and the needs of children to survive. In most other stories of this genre, adults still exist, so society does not need to be completely reinvented. However, children do not always have the socialization or maturity to make the logical decisions the older part of humanity takes as a given. This gives the Tribe an interesting spin, as anarchy and hormones vie with intelligence and understanding from a child or young adult perspective. In many cases, this is refreshing and invigorating to Tribe viewers. I ask you, how many times in your adult life would you have liked to wipe the slate clean and start over? Looking at the ""tabula rosa"" scenario is enticing, both personally and (in this election year in the USA) politically. The Tribe allows people to envision a new start, but also portrays the pitfalls and problems that would most assuredly occur. It gives me, personally, a chance to dream of a different reality in another time, while also reminding me that the decisions we make as adults may have unexpected and far-reaching consequences to future generations. I hope the Tribe continues, in some form, for a long time, and I have whole-heartedly recommended it to my peers and their children and teens.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A

2005,WBQC,UPN,Cincinnati,3,Analog,THE LITTLES,Non-Core,Syndicated,MTW/5:30AM,39,0,30,5,9,"Concept and Approach: Imagine a community of creatures 4 inches tall – half-human, half-mouse. These are The Littles – and they may be living in the walls of your house. In most ways The Littles act and think like Bigs (some folks call them Humans), but their sense of wonder, their thirst for adventure, and their capacity for kindness sets them apart. This series focuses on one particular family of Littles – Grandpa (gruff, wise, and intent on sharing his wisdom with the younger Littles), Mom and Dad, Dinky (an irrepressible teen with a wild imagination who can be counted on to leap before he looks), and the two youngest: Tom and Lucy. They inhabit the walls of the home of 12-year-old Henry Big and his parents. Henry is the only Human who knows about the Littles; his archeologist parents who know that their boy sometimes acts a little strangely, and occasionally appears to talk to the walls, but don’t really know why. The only one who Henry’s suspects Henry’s secret is a sinister scientist named Hunter. He believes, but cannot prove, that the Littles exist, and strives to capture them to prove his theory. These elements provide the ingredients for constant adventure, constant surprise, and engaging prosocial lessons. In their quest to become productive adults, the Littles and their friend Henry face the same kinds of problems that young children face every day – issues of friendship, jealousy, honesty, prejudice, consideration for others, kindness, responsibility, risk-taking … and more. Each episode of the Littles focuses on one such issue, presenting it in explicit, concrete terms. And young, attractive characters with whom children can identify carry out these actions, they serve as excellent role models for young viewers. Younger and older children, boys and girls, loners and social butterflies…all can find a character with whom to identify and from whom to learn. And last but far from least, the character of Grandpa, a wise, experienced, older Little who clearly loves and cares for the Little kids, functions as the kind of non-threatening, non-didactic teacher to whom children respond. He frequently articulates the lesson inherent in the action as he interacts with and advises the Little children. He is the best kind of teacher. The exciting adventures of the Littles and the suspense generated by their frequent narrow escapes from Dr Hunter are designed to capture and hold young viewers’ attention. The explicitness with which each lesson is articulated and role models with whom children can identify are designed to ensure that children note and understand the embedded prosocial content as they derive delight from the action.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
2005,WBQC,UPN,Cincinnati,3,Analog,INSPECTOR'S GADGET FIELD TRIP,Non-Core,Syndicated,THF/530AM,26,0,30,8,11,"Core topics:World geography (physical and cultural), history, and science Goal: To engage and stimulate interest in learning about the diverse regions, cultures, and histories that characterize today’s world. Curriculum Overview: Class field trips – remember them? A chance for kids to see how some of the things they learn about in the classroom take form in the real world. And perhaps more important, a chance for good teachers to expose kids to new, exciting ideas – the kinds of ideas that not only excite kids, but that made the return to the classroom more engaging, more fun. Of course, for most kids most field trips stick relatively close to home. After all, everybody has to be back at school the next day. That is, unless they take one of Inspector Gadget’s Field Trips. He can take kids anywhere in the world. In this series, Inspector Gadget (and the voice of Don Adams), one of children’s all-time favorite animated characters, leads 8 – 11-year-olds on field trips to some of the most interesting, exciting places in the world: London, China, the NASA Space Center, the Old West, and more. Combining animation with live-action footage, they are journeys filled with fascinating sights and exciting insights. We see how people live in other parts of the world (and sometimes in other historical eras). The shows reveal both differences and commonalities among various peoples, various cultures. Most trips contain some geography, some history, some science … and a whole lot of social science. Inspector Gadget’s Field Trips, produced in cooperation with the National Education Association (NEA), exposes young viewers to some of the most interesting geographical and historical sights in the world. It is designed not only to teach about the larger world in which today’s kids live, but more important, it is designed to engage their interest and stimulate their desire to learn more. By exposing young kids to the colorful facts, quirks, and interesting legends and lore associated with the places they visit, each episode is designed to spark viewers’ imagination – to excite them with the idea of finding out more about their world. In short, the goal of Inspector Gadget’s Field Trips is not only to teach kids about distant places, but to promote the belief that knowing about our complex world is both interesting and fun.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
