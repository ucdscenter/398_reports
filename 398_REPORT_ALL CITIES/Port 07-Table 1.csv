As Strawberry and her friends explore the richly-imagined world of Strawberry Land they discover adventure, delight, fantasy, whimsy, humor, excitement, and music. And they encounter problems. The interaction among Strawberry and her friends as they explore their world and deal with the problems inherent in their adventures offers a natural opportunity to present (as opposed to preach) pro-social beliefs, values, and behaviors. Strawberry Shortcake is a natural leader. She hosts the series and tells the stories. Most importantly, she is an ideal role model. And just as important as Strawberry’s many positive qualities, she is surrounded by a small circle of friends, most of whom share her values, but not necessarily her ability to take the broader view – to see beyond their own self-interest. As Strawberry helps them broaden their views, young viewers learn a wide array of positive values and actions.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A

In their quest to become productive adults, the Littles and their friend Henry face the same kinds of problems that young children face every day - issues of friendship, jealousy, honesty, prejudice, consideration for others, kindness, responsibility, risk-taking ... and more. Each episode of the Littles focuses on one such issue, presenting it in explicit, concrete terms. And young, attractive characters with whom children can identify carry out these actions, they serve as excellent role models for young viewers. Younger and older children, boys and girls, loners and social butterflies...all can find a character with whom to identify and from whom to learn. And last but far from least, the character of Grandpa, a wise, experienced, older Little who clearly loves and cares for the Little kids, functions as the kind of non-threatening, non-didactic teacher to whom children respond. He frequently articulates the lesson inherent in the action as he interacts with and advises the Little children. He is the best kind of teacher. The exciting adventures of the Littles and the suspense generated by their frequent narrow escapes from Dr Hunter are designed to capture and hold young viewers' attention. The explicitness with which each lesson is articulated and role models with whom children can identify are designed to ensure that children note and understand the embedded pro-social content as they derive delight from the action.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
