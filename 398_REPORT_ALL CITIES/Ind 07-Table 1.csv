The series adresses important age-relevant topics in a direct and honest fashion. While adolescents will certainly have some awareness of issues presented, the series provides vivid representations of dilemmas along with solid information about how they can be handled. Many of these problems emerge from within the peer culture as well as occasionally from expectations and conflicts that adults may be experiencing. Resolutions emerge through peer discussions and direct experiences. Viewing these situations in the often entertaining and engrossing format of the series may also yield opportunities for teenagers to express any concerns they may have about their own choices and the consequences portrayed in each episode. The Degrassi series exemplifies topics such as bullying, cliques, dating, sexuality concerns, conflicts between friends, relationships with teachers and parents, substance abuse, and school pressures both intellectual and social. All of these problems reflect concerns youth may encounter in the sometimes-tumultuous world of middle school and high school. The series also addresses the difficulties and opportunities for communication between adolescents and their parents and teachers. Often youth may have difficulty recognizing or expressing and confronting their own issues. Degrassi can act as a catalyst for young people who may be experiencing some of the problems presented on the show. Guides on the Internet are provided for the episodes to parents and teachers to talk with young people. The recurring casts of characters who appear in the 30-minute episodes of Degrassi represent a diversity of personalities, ethnic backgrounds, body types and class distinctions affording the viewers opportunities for identification or modeling behaviors. None of these young people are reflected as perfect or demonstrate super human qualities.

A little kid's world is apt to be replete with challenges and conundrums, as well as enjoyment and satisfaction. How does one deal with the possibility of monsters in a darkened room, the adventure of the first day of school, the necessity to mark your artwork with your name, the difficulty of finding something to do on a rainy day, or tying your shoes for the first time? On an episode by episode basis, Will & Dewitt, along with their human and animal friends, face these challenges and more, often overcoming them by means of their own brand of ingenuity and perseverance, mixed with an ample dose of joy and humor. As they do so, Will & Dewitt point up the fact that it's O.K. to be fallible in the course of learning.

Along with this esential skill-based and pro-social education, the series also gives viewers an opportunity to learn and practice those primary knowledge-based understandings and skills on which much future learning is based.

The series adresses important age-relevant topics in a direct and honest fashion. While adolescents will certainly have some awareness of issues presented, the series provides vivid representations of dilemmas along with solid information about how they can be handled. Many of these problems emerge from within the peer culture as well as occasionally from expectations and conflicts that adults may be experiencing. Resolutions emerge through peer discussions and direct experiences. Viewing these situations in the often entertaining and engrossing format of the series may also yield opportunities for teenagers to express any concerns they may have about their own choices and the consequences portrayed in each episode. The Degrassi series exemplifies topics such as bullying, cliques, dating, sexuality concerns, conflicts between friends, relationships with teachers and parents, substance abuse, and school pressures both intellectual and social. All of these problems reflect concerns youth may encounter in the sometimes-tumultuous world of middle school and high school. The series also addresses the difficulties and opportunities for communication between adolescents and their parents and teachers. Often youth may have difficulty recognizing or expressing and confronting their own issues. Degrassi can act as a catalyst for young people who may be experiencing some of the problems presented on the show. Guides on the Internet are provided for the episodes to parents and teachers to talk with young people. The recurring casts of characters who appear in the 30-minute episodes of Degrassi represent a diversity of personalities, ethnic backgrounds, body types and class distinctions affording the viewers opportunities for identification or modeling behaviors. None of these young people are reflected as perfect or demonstrate super human qualities. Each character may demonstrate flaws or misgivings as well as opportunities for overcoming difficulties, for helping others, and improving their own character.
