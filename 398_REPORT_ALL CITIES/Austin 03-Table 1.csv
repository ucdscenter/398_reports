""Humans and wild animals are very similar to one another -- we both need clean air, clean water, food, shelter and open space. My goal with Wild Moments is to bridge that gap, to demonstrate how the welfare of wildlife, mankind and Planet Earth are connected and dependent on each other. Plus, I want to reacquaint viewers -- adults and kids, alike -- with their fuzzy neighbors, so that they have fun and feel as though they learned something after tuning into the show.""
