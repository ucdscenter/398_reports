Darcy’s initial resentment gives way to optimism as she makes new friends and becomes a part of the community. The overarching educational goal is for the audience to see how the main character, Darcy, is able to make a successful adjustment to a new environment that is the complete antithesis of her old life. Darcy comes to a deeper understanding of herself, the value of relationships, and the insignificance of material things. This occurs as she makes new friends who have totally different perspectives than hers. The viewer will also learn about the care and treatment of a variety of animals that live on farms or in the wild.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
