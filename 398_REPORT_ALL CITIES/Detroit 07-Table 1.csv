Carried by the wind, the letter is en route to the North Pole when Piglet and Winnie the Pooh realize that Pooh forgot to request a present. They intercept the letter in order to add Poohâ??s request. Some members of the group become greedy and add additional presents to the list. Pooh posts the new letter, but it blows back inside his front door. By the time he discovers the letter it is too late for it to arrive before Christmas Eve. In desperation, Pooh and Piglet dress up as Santa and a reindeer and bring home-made gifts to the others. The improvised gifts fall apart and there is disappointment. Pooh vows to hand-deliver the letter to Santa, even if it means that he will not be home until after Christmas. Poohâ??s friends immediately regret having allowed him to leave for the North Pole. Fortunately, Pooh returns at that point, apologizing for failing to deliver the letter to Santa in time for the holiday. His friends assure him that his presence is all they need to make Christmas a happy one. Their selflessness is rewarded: Santa leaves each his longed-for gift on Christmas morning. In this story the Hundred Acres Wood gang learns a valuable lesson about holiday perspective. Each comes to realize that happiness is derived from giving, not receiving, and that â??Being with friends is the nicest gift of all.â?",99,N/A,4,Y
