While adolescents will certainly have some awareness of issues presented, the series provides vivid representations of dilemmas along with solid information about how they can be handled. Many of these problems emerge from within the peer culture as well as occasionally from expectations and conflicts that adults may be experiencing. Resolutions emerge through peer discussions and direct experiences. Viewing these situations in the often entertaining and engrossing format of the series may also yield opportunities for teenagers to express any concerns they may have about their own choices and the consequences portrayed in each episode. The Degrassi series exemplifies topics such as bullying, cliques, dating, sexuality concerns, conflicts between friends, relationships with teachers and parents, substance abuse, and school pressures both intellectual and social. All of these problems reflect concerns youth may encounter in the sometimes-tumultuous world of middle school and high school. The series also addresses the difficulties and opportunities for communication between adolescents and their parents and teachers. Often youth may have difficulty recognizing or expressing and confronting their own issues. Degrassi can act as a catalyst for young people who may be experiencing some of the problems presented on the show.

The series addresses important age-relevant topics in a direct and honest fashion. While adolescents will certainly have some awareness of issues presented, the series provides vivid representations of dilemmas along with solid information about how they can be handled. Many of these problems emerge from within the peer culture as well as occasionally from expectations and conflicts that adults may be experiencing. Resolutions emerge through peer discussions and direct experiences. Viewing these situations in the often entertaining and engrossing format of the series may also yield opportunities for teenagers to express any concerns they may have about their own choices and the consequences portrayed in each episode. The Degrassi series exemplifies topics such as bullying, cliques, dating, sexuality concerns, conflicts between friends, relationships with teachers and parents, substance abuse, and school pressures both intellectual and social. All of these problems reflect concerns youth may encounter in the sometimes-tumultuous world of middle school and high school. The series also addresses the difficulties and opportunities for communication between adolescents and their parents and teachers. Often youth may have difficulty recognizing or expressing and confronting their own issues. Degrassi can act as a catalyst for young people who may be experiencing some of the problems presented on the show. Guides on the Internet are provided for the episodes to parents and teachers to talk with young people. The recurring casts of characters who appear in the 30-minute episodes of Degrassi represent a diversity of personalities, ethnic backgrounds, body types and class distinctions affording the viewers opportunities for identification or modeling behaviors.

It has addressed issues appropriate for general public and the secondary classroom with a presentation that included large numbers of clips, wide ranging photography, fast-paced editing, and a non condescending vocabulary level. The programs in the latest series of Animal Atlas happily maintain those strengths. It is differentiated from previous years by its sense of humor. Entertaining the viewer with wit and observation augents the educational integrity of its content. The level of humor, like the level of vocabulary, is the most suited for middle school (ages 13-16) with applications of topics that could extend into the higher grades. There are sound cues, visual elements, and a general tone that supports the delivery of educational material in a way that is appropriate for entertainment television. The date delivered and the content communicated is absolutely educational in nature and value but done in a way that would hold the attention of the target viewer. While the program is consistently humorouse, a middle school teacher could construct textbook materials that would be applicable to Animal Atlas. Examples of content covered: The determinant classifications of the ape and monkey primate families; the compairson of structure and function of species physiology; the emphasis on the recent scientific replacement classicication of smaller apes for lesser apes. A new and welcome element is an interview segment with scientiest (the Gibbons episode). Done with an emphasis on the passion of scientific careers, the interviews add an element of career awareness that opens the door for young viewers. Although there are new program elements, the program thankfully continues its use of interactive segment with multiple choice questions. As before, these are not based upon program content but upon related information with appeal to the viewer's knowledge, e.g. as the answer to a multiple choice question, viewers are informed that the origin of the word lemur is from the Latin for ghost.
