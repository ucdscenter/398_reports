It offers scientific content, scientific theories, the vocabulary and facts of science and the processes of scientific thinking. The scientific content of Beakman's World overlaps with a significant number of the standards for science education that are prevalent in the curricula of today's schools. In the physical science area for instance, Beakman both discussed and demonstrated the concepts of density and displacement with an experiment explaining why a steel boat floats while a steel bar sinks. In the life science area, Beakman explained the concept of migration and illustrated it with video of migrating birds, butterflies, caribou, salmon and grey whales. Throughout the series, Beakman conducts replicable experiments to illustrate the processes of investigation and experimentation. In addition to the scientific content of the episodes of Beakman's World it is also important to point out that the design of the series will appeal to the target age group. This age group represents the span from early adolescence through the teen-age years. These are years of transition for youngsters from late childhood to adulthood. They are moving from dependence to independence and toward greater autonomy and self-reliance. Their cognitive capabilities expand and their thinking becomes more adult-like. During this time of separation from adult authority, youngsters seek out non-traditional sources of authority. Paul Zaloom's portrayal of Beakman is exactly that a non-traditional source of authority who answers science questions in a non-traditional way. The quirky, humorous, lively and colorful production values of Beakman's World will appeal to youngsters in the 13 to 16 year old age group.",99,N/A,4,Y

Except for her family, only her two best friends, Oliver and Lilly, and her bodyguard know about Mylie's career as a singer, and she strives to maintain privacy, fearing that her new classmates would treat her very differently if they knew of her stage identity. Mylie wears blonde wigs while performing, and manages to escape being recognized. Mylie's mother died three years before the story begins, so her dad is now a single parent. He has just begun dating again. Mylie misses her mother very much. One of the songs that she writes and performs is about the pain of growing up without her mother. Unlike her brother, Mylie is a dedicated student. At school, her enemies are Amber and Ashley, two girls who constantly bully Mylie. Oliver and Lilly are fiercely protective of their friend. Mylie has ordinary teenage insecurities, but remains true to herself, despite the allure of concert life, the limos, parties, and glamorous clothes. This is in no small part due to the solid values that her father, Mylie's manager (Billy Rae Cyrus), has imparted.

The series, rated TV-PG addresses important age?relevant topics in a direct and honest fashion. While adolescents will certainly have some awareness of issues presented, the series provides vivid representations of dilemmas along with solid information about how they can be handled. Many of these problems emerge from within the peer culture as well as occasionally from expectations and conflicts that adults may be experiencing. Resolutions emerge through peer discussions and direct experiences. Viewing these situations in the often entertaining and engrossing format of the series may also yield opportunities for teenagers to express any concerns they may have about their own choices and the consequences portrayed in each episode. The Degrassi series exemplifies topics such as bullying, cliques, dating, sexuality concerns, conflicts between friends, relationships with teachers and parents, substance abuse, and school pressures both intellectual and social. All of these problems reflect concerns youth may encounter in the sometimes-tumultuous world of middle school and high school. The series also addresses the difficulties and opportunities for communication between adolescents and their parents and teachers. Often youth may have difficulty recognizing or expressing and confronting their own issues. Degrassi can act as a catalyst for young people who may be experiencing some of the problems presented on the show. Guides on the Internet are provided for the episodes to parents and teachers to talk with young people. The recurring casts of characters who appear in the 30-minute episodes of Degrassi represent a diversity of personalities, ethnic backgrounds, body types and class distinctions affording the viewers opportunities for identification or modeling behaviors.
