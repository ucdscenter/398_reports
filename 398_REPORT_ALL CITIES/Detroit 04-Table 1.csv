2004,WADL-TV,N/A,DETROIT,4,ANALOG,ACE LIGHTNING,CORE,SYNDICATED,MON-FRI 7:00-7:30 AM,66,0,30,8,11,"Ace Lightning is a prosocial series promoting the idea that there is a little hero in each of us, and examining the various qualities that 8 – 11-year-olds need to think about and develop in order to make such “heroism” emerge. Not everyone can save the world and none of us are superheroes, but each of us can be a hero if we do the right thing – whether it’s befriending an unpopular classmate, telling the truth even if it gets us into trouble, accepting responsibilities even when they demand sacrifices, and standing up for what we know is right. Mark Hollander, a 13-year-old human, new to his town, his school, and the idea of being a hero, is about to learn some of these lessons…the hard way. “Do right and fear not!” This is the credo of Ace Lightning, an animated superhero from a video game who, through a freak electrical storm, finds himself battling super villains (Lord Fear and the forces of evil) on Earth – in a human setting. Ace encounters Mark Hollander, a “normal adolescent” who certainly does not conceive of himself as a hero in any sense of the word. Mark has just moved from England to North America; he is beginning a new year at a new school where he will be the new guy. He needs to figure out this new place. He needs to meet and make new friends. He needs to fit in! He does not need to be a hero! All he wants is to be a normal guy. But Ace Lightning needs help saving the world, and when he calls on Mark for aid, circumstances combine to draw the young teenager into the action. Little by little, Mark begins to discover that there can be some hero in each one of us, and well as to learn just what it takes to be a hero. Mark’s gradual discovery that he possesses most of the qualities necessary to be a hero, if only he will work hard, trust in his beliefs and abilities, do the right thing, and fear not, combines with Ace Lightning’s growing understanding of human feelings, emotions, and values, to provide positive social models for 8 – 11 year old viewers. As our two protagonists – one a digital superhero and the other an average human boy who is a hero in the making – battle Lord Fear and the forces of evil, they display the kinds of behaviors, beliefs, and values that most parents would like to see their own children adopt. Each episode faces Mark with moral and ethical decisions of the kind that are required not only in a confrontation with the forces of evil, but also in dealing with the day-to-day events of normal lives. Each episode faces Ace with one or more dimensions of human character, and he begins to understand and adopt many positive human attributes. Throughout the course of the series, such prosocial issues as friendship, compassion, ingenuity, humor, honesty, integrity, perseverance, duty, honor, truthfulness, and respect for others are explored. Exciting adventure, an engaging model, and a host of problems of the kind that young viewers can identify with, all combine to make Ace Lightning an excellent vehicle to promote prosocial beliefs and behavior.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
