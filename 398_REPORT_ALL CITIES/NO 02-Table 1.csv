Those who have not given blood express various fears--dislike of needles and pain, worries about screening and disease. The regular donors counter many of these fears and offer many reasons for donating: the good feeling of having helped someone, the great need for blood in light of decreased donations because of the AIDS epidemic, and the incentive it provides to take care of yourself. They also talk about the ease of donating and allay the viewer's fears about contracting AIDS by mentioning that a fresh needle is used for every donor. A Pint of Life demonstrates some of the many things science has learned to do with a single pint of blood and features ""testimonials"" of people whose lives have been saved by donated blood: a woman with cancer, an organ transplant recipient, and, the most touching of all--a three-year- old, given transfusions during a heart transplant at five months, who is now old enough to say ""Thank You!""

If their body type does not happen to fit the thin image they emulate, they are often made to feel like outcasts or freaks and may starve themselves, exercise exhaustively, abuse laxatives, and engage in binge-purge eating behaviors to keep off the dreaded weight. Thin Dreams creatively combines documentary interviews with dramatic improvisation to explore some of the issues surrounding the drive toward thinness. Young women will recognize themselves and their friends in this film and hopefully will find the courage to begin to resist the pressures they are experiencing and become more accepting of the very real physical differences that our genetic patterns dictate. The film can be used with young women from ages 10 to 21 in any setting in which personal health issues are being discussed. It can be an effective tool for prevention of eating disorders as well as an incentive for interrupting the progression of ongoing abnormal eating behaviors ",99,N/A,N/A,N/A

He rakes his parents over the coals for their ""pc attitudes,"" obsession with the environment, toxic waste and recycling. But this monologue has a darker side as well. The boy admits to having an ulcer, seeing a therapist, and refusing to talk in school. He admits to being scared and thinks his father is too, but they can't talk about it. ",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
