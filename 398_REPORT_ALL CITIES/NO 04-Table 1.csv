It uses powerful storytelling to address three primary educational goals: 1. To introduce young people to an extensive cast of remarkable historical figures, from Ben Franklin to Phillis Wheatley, and to enable them to understand the incredible sacrifices these individuals made to help found the United States. 2. To guide young people through the entire sequence of amazing events that led to the creation of a new nation, from the homes of ordinary Americans and the meeting halls from Virginia to Massachusetts to the numerous battlefields in the colonies and the royal courts of France and England. 3. To help young people understand the importance of key philosophical, social and political issues at the heart of the American Revolution by setting these issues in actual historical contexts, by having individuals such as Jefferson and Paine explain these issues and by seeing the impact of these issues on the lives of ordinary citizens. And to always to do so in ways that are age-appropriate for our target audience. While based on historical events, Liberty's Kids touches on issues that are still current in modern America - taxation, freedom of the press, race relations, the role of government, and even the right to bear arms.
