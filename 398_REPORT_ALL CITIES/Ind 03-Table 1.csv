All Dogs Go To Heaven uses highly entertaining and engaging stories and characters to present prosocial messages aimed at promoting young children's social and emotional development. The vehicle is the ongoing saga of Charlie Barkin and Itchy Itchford, two dogs who return to earth from heaven in the role of reluctant guardian angels. Charlie, a street-smart, wisecracking, dog-of-all-scams was not ready to go to heaven - he was having too much fun on earth. Anabelle, the arc-angel in charge of dogs, gives him a choice: He can return to earth, but only as a Guardian Angel, charged with doing - and being - good! No more scams; no more wise guy antics. Given that the options range from zero to none, Charlie accepts the challenge, and the always loyal Itchy joins him. Not surprisingly, Charlie is constantly torn between his role as a guardian angel and his yearnings for his pre-angelic, down-and-dirty, dog-about-town life. He constantly confronts situations and dilemmas that highlight the kinds of social and character issues that are fundamental to developing children. These include such issues as: honesty versus lying, selfishness versus selflessness, bragging, taking the perspective of others, cheating, winning at all costs, respecting other's individuality, being honest about your feelings, to mention just a few. Charlie's struggle to do the right thing reflects the kinds of struggles young children often confront in social and/or emotional situations in their own lives. Fortunately, Itchy is frequently there to help Charlie, and young viewers, understand just what the right thing is. As attractive characters engaging in exciting, humorous adventures, Charlie and Itchy serve as excellent models to help young viewers learn what ""all dogs"" and ""all people"" should ultimately learn...if they want to go to heaven, that is.

And young, attractive characters with whom children can identify carry out these actions, they serve as excellent role models for young viewers.

And last but far from least, the character of Grandpa, a wise, experienced, older Little who clearly loves and cares for the Little kids, functions as the kind of non-threatening, non-didactic teacher to whom children respond. He frequently articulates the lesson inherent in the action as he interacts with and advises the Little children. He is the best kind of teacher. The exciting adventures of the Littles and the suspense generated by their frequent narrow escapes from Dr Hunter are designed to capture and hold young viewers' attention. The explicitness with which each lesson is articulated and role models with whom children can identify are designed to ensure that children note and understand the embedded pro-social content as they derive delight from the action.
