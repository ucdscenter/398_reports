However, at times Raven worries that she is a “freak” because of her clairvoyant abilities. She has a younger brother, Cory, age ten. They are typical siblings, with the tension and rivalry that most siblings experience. Raven attends public high school. Both parents are employed outside the home. They are loving parents, and good disciplinarians. Raven is often responsible for the after-school safety and activities of her brother, Cory. Her closest friends are Chelsea and Eddie, who are fiercely committed to environmental issues and sports, respectively. Raven’s parents and closest friends know about her “visions” of the immediate future. The premonitions often prompt her to attempt to intervene before trouble occurs. Sometimes Raven’s interventions backfire, and at other times the foreseen events come true, bringing embarrassment or sadness. Raven learns valuable lessons from her blunders and transgressions.

The boys attend the local public middle school and are in the same class. One of the twins is polite and shy and excels in academics, while the other, an athlete and extrovert, barely scrapes by in school, due to disinterest and lack of effort, and instead often instigates wacky plans for outwitting hotel authorities, caregivers, and their mother. The boy's mother dates and would like to remarry. Their father is a professional rock musician who is on the road much of the year, but who stays in touch with his boys. This sets up occasional parental “conflicts” about discipline and expectations. Parallel stories involve two teenage girls: heiress London Tipton, whose father owns the hotel, and Maddie, the girl who works after school at the hotel snack bar. Unlike London, Maddie attends a parochial girls’ school and comes from a working class family. Both Zack and Cody have crushes on Maddie, who is four years older than they.

2005,KCOP,UPN,Los Angeles,5,Analog,TROLLZ,Core,Syndicated,M-F at 7am (10/1/05-12/31/05),65,0,30,8,12,"Mission: To engage and entertain 8 – 12-year-olds while portraying and promoting positive character development and interpersonal skills relevant to issues that confront today’s children. Need: Surveys consistently find that parents of grade school children want their children to acquire a range of positive attributes and abilities, including such personal characteristics as honesty, responsibility, independence, self-confidence, perseverance, etc., and such social attitudes and skills as respect for diversity, cooperation, friendliness, choosing friends wisely, getting along with others, cooperation, and more. Parents are also consistent in their belief that it is difficult to locate television programs that model such attributes for young viewers. Between the ages of eight and twelve, children’s lives change dramatically. These years mark a transition from relative dependence to relative independence – from a world in which most activities revolve around the immediate family to one marked by growing mobility and contact with new people, new situations, new ideas. Perhaps most important, it is a new world requiring children to make myriad independent, individual decisions. They must figure out how to maintain family connections and meet family expectations at the same time that they begin to establish independence, explore new information, join a variety of different social groups, and respond to new demands “outside” the family. As children’s personal and social worlds expand, they confront a good deal of uncertainty. They are faced with figuring out how to function as independent beings at the same time their concern with “fitting in” begins to grow. Their need to belong – to a family, to a peer group, to a variety of institutions – sometimes seems to run counter to their need to be self-reliant and independent – their own individual. Small wonder that the world can seem a confusing and scary place to today’s kids. Small wonder, too, that parents indicate they would appreciate some help from more television programming promoting the kinds of positive values and behaviors that can help children navigate these critical years. Concept and approach: Imagine five troll girlz on the cusp of adolescence…their “gems” (gemstones that reside in the navel of every Troll female) have begun to glow! In the Troll world a glowing gem is a sign of an emerging ability to work magic. It is also a sign change. Each of our five Trollz are about to discover that their glowing gem is the harbinger not only of new powers, but also of new expectations, new challenges, new responsibilities. Their power is not just a toy! Indeed, this particular group of five girlz is about to discover that their new-found magic may bring with it the power to restore the land of Trollz to its former glory. If only they can learn to use their new abilities in the right way – if only they can develop the strength of character to recognize and do the right thing…and the social skills to do it effectively. As our five young heroines struggle to master their new-found powers, they also struggle to figure out what it means to be a good citizen, a good friend, a good person. They face the kinds of issues that every child faces – how to accept responsibility even at personal cost, how to deal with jealousy, what being a good friend really means, respect for differences and recognition of the power of diversity, when to ask for help and when to be self-reliant, the value of cooperation, the dangers of procrastination, the importance of being oneself…. Most young viewers will recognize some part of our Trollz either in themselves or in their friends. Each of the five exemplifies typical personality characteristics of today’s kids: Ruby, spoiled, materialistic, self-assured to the point of arrogance; Amethyst, sweet, trusting, honest, and almost too good to be true; Onyx, cynical, sardonic, with a devastatingly perceptive wit; Topaz, ditzy, sweet, never gets the joke, but the best friend one could have; Sapphire, smart, organized, extremely competent, and proud of her brains. Each brings something to the table – each has a great deal to learn from the others…and from their Ancients. Ancients are Trollz “elders” who serve as the girlz’ teachers and counselors. And they need counseling, not only because they aren’t really sure about how to handle their new-found magical powers, but also because their combined magic seems to have awakened Simon, an evil gremlin who has been imprisoned in the shadow world for 3000 years, and who now plans to conquer Trollzopolis! As the Trollz struggle to master and control their developing magic powers, their developing friendship, their developing personalities, their developing responsibilities, and the evil schemes of Simon (and his monster dog Snarf!), they confront many of the same issues, crises, and dilemmas faced by kids around the world. As they struggle to work out these issues, the five young Trollz function as models of both positive individual characteristics and positive social behavior. They make many mistakes, but they correct them and learn from them. They help each other; they teach each other; they take care of each other. They display and they talk about the kinds of values, behaviors, and traits that most parents say they want in their children. And the girlz do all this in the context of the funny, mysterious, and magical world of Trollz (plus an occasional gremlin, ogre, and monster or two). Trollz presents attractive, engaging characters and entertaining story lines that examine the kinds of issues and situations today’s children confront. It examines those issues in explicit, concrete terms that children can understand. In short, Trollz is a prime example of the power of combining good story telling and prosocial messages.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
