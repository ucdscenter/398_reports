2006,WBXN-CA,MYNETWORK,NEW ORLEANS,3,ANALOG,NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC'S REALLY WILD ANIMALS,CORE,SYNDICATED,SUN 8:30AM,14,0,30,8,12,"This series of videos on wild animals, birds, and insects in their natural environments is designed to engage the curiosity and developing intelligence of boys and girls in the beginning school years. There is a special emphasis on nature, science, the adaptation, and survival of species, and their role in human planetary welfare. Each episode examines topics of Geography, Ecology, and the ways in which non-humans; animals, birds and insects adjust to the complexities of their specific habitats in the various continents and oceans that make up our planet, Earth. 1. Reaching and Teaching The episodes are designed specifically to engage the special cognitive and social/emotional capacities of this age group. The use of a humorous, playful representation of our globe in the form of Spin, voiced very clearly and in a lively “fun” manner by Dudley Moore is designed to create a story-like frame that is likely to attract this age group. Spin comes across as a sometime blundering story-teller who will appeal to children who are curious but also often somewhat inclined to be quizzical of the formalities of instruction. Dudley Moore with his clear speech and light tone seems to represent an excellent spokesperson that can present extensive information to children while avoiding a formal, didactic approach. 2 .Major Instructional Topics The content of the episodes, while focused primarily on depictions of animals in their natural habitats, contain important subtexts that are regularly repeated in many shows. These include examples of the vast variability of living species on different continents with indications of the fact that all sizes and shapes of birds, animals, and insects demonstrate remarkable means of adjusting to often extremely difficult ecological circumstances. While children are easily attracted to the big animals like elephants, lions, crocodiles, the series calls continuing attention to the remarkable constructive abilities and seeming social complexity of tiny meercat felines, beavers with their dam and lodge building, ants in their complex societies and especially the amazing termite towers, and the elegant mating rituals of bower birds. For the viewers in this age group, facing first exposures to a wider world outside of their own families, the series presents a key educational opportunity. Children can learn about the unusual kinds of animal home-building, of how various species gather food, or are predators who must also protect themselves or their young, or how many survive only by remarkable migrations. Because early school-age children are at the same time family-dependent, yet increasingly exposed to new settings, they sustain a strong interest in issues of childcare and safety. A recurrent feature throughout the series reflects issues of baby-care, and protection with examples of elephants to tortoises, from wallabies to koalas. There are many instances about the habits and pranks of primates and monkeys that not only delight children but also offer an easy opportunity for identification. At a more subtle level, there are continuing examples of animal life that may encourage children to think for the first time about critical issues of ecology and of the importance of preserving natural habitats for many species to survive in the face of widespread human incursions. The information about the beaver and the dam building of ponds stresses how this one animal contributes to the making an agreeable habitat for a variety of fish, fowl and insects. The critical importance for humans of preservation of tropical rainforest is well demonstrated in a manner easily grasped by this age group. Examples of humans as rescuers of endangered young animals are vividly presented. In Australia, the cute koala is often left homeless as the Eucalyptus trees that they depend on for food and shelter are cut down. Demonstrating how an orphaned, homeless koala is rescued by humans, nurtured, and then gradually returned to its habitat is a memorable example. Other comparable stories woven into episodes about baby pandas in China and even an orphaned black bear, nurtured by humans and then adopted by an unrelated mother are well presented. These vignettes appeal to the social and emotional feelings of the target viewers. These many instances also may convey a first exposure of children to the interdependence of humans and animals. The series offer a useful array of examples for children of how we can understand, respect, and appreciate the world of the other living organisms that share our planet without anthropomorphosis of other creatures. The episodes still show the natural ways in which we as humans can relate to the many other living species. The many examples of scientific research, of human rescue and care facilities for species such as eagles and wild horses, and the importance of natural habitat preservation all bring children a sense of fellowship with the animal world and greater understanding of nature. 3. Supplementary Learning Opportunities In addition to the major instructional thrusts of the series, there are some additional educational opportunities. Perhaps the most obvious is the area of expanded cognitive skills such as planning, problems solving, and, vocabulary. Unfamiliar words are explained by the host, and at times, supers on the screen help the viewer learn the names of animals or concepts such as migration, pouch. Other cognitive skills are enhanced by the use of maps or names of continents. Children become acquainted with how the sensory modalities of vision, smell, and hearing are used by animals to recognize their young as in the case of the zebra. Even the sonar-like sounds by bats and other nocturnal animals are exemplified. The uses of story segments within the episodes also are valuable for children, not only for sustaining interest but also as demonstration narrative thinking as a useful aid to memory. The baby wildebeest’s survival over several hundred miles of migration is a fine instance. Broken into segments but carefully preserving story-continuity, it helps children practice how to recognize sequences and refresh memories. At a more social level, the content of the many construction and childcare depictions demonstrates the value of cooperative behavior. The mother emu in Australia gives birth to eggs, but the father then sits on them, warming and guarding them, and oversees their hatching. The sharing of food and the nurturing of young in a great variety of animals, birds, aquaria, and insect species is powerfully demonstrated.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A

As Strawberry and her many friends explore the richly-imagined world of Strawberry they discover adventure, delight, fantasy, whimsy, humor, excitement, and music. And of course, they also encounter occasional problems. The interaction among Strawberry and her friends as they explore their world and deal with the problems inherent in their adventures offers a natural opportunity to present (as opposed to preach) pro-social beliefs, values, and behaviors. Strawberry Shortcake is a natural leader. She hosts the series and tells the stories. And most important, she is an ideal role model. Strawberry is curious, active, self-confident, and always willing to make her world a better place. She learns from her mistakes. No matter how hard she tumbles, she always picks herself up. Strawberry personifies the belief that hard-work, sacrifice, and caring will usually set things right. And just as important as Strawberry’s many positive qualities, she is surrounded by small circle of friends, most of whom share her values, but not necessarily her ability to take the broader view – to see beyond their own self-interest. As Strawberry helps them broaden their views, young viewers learn a wide array of positive values and actions. The themes underlying the stories that Strawberry Shortcake recounts in each episode are designed to have particular relevance for young viewers. Although they focus on “big” issues such as friendship, fear, self-confidence, sportsmanship, shyness, trust, love, they approach the themes in ways that are relevant to pre-school children. The stories focus on these issues in clear, concrete terms that are easily comprehended by young children. The pro-social messages flow naturally from the narrative. The characters experience concrete consequences for their actions – both good and bad – and the reasons for the consequences are clearly labeled. The stories are told in ways that make the messages clear, but not overbearing.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A

2006,WUPL,MYNETWORK,NEW ORLEANS,3,ANALOG,NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC'S REALLY WILD ANIMALS,CORE,SYNDICATED,SUN 8:30AM,14,0,30,8,12,"This series of videos on wild animals, birds, and insects in their natural environments is designed to engage the curiosity and developing intelligence of boys and girls in the beginning school years. There is a special emphasis on nature, science, the adaptation, and survival of species, and their role in human planetary welfare. Each episode examines topics of Geography, Ecology, and the ways in which non-humans; animals, birds and insects adjust to the complexities of their specific habitats in the various continents and oceans that make up our planet, Earth. 1. Reaching and Teaching The episodes are designed specifically to engage the special cognitive and social/emotional capacities of this age group. The use of a humorous, playful representation of our globe in the form of Spin, voiced very clearly and in a lively “fun” manner by Dudley Moore is designed to create a story-like frame that is likely to attract this age group. Spin comes across as a sometime blundering story-teller who will appeal to children who are curious but also often somewhat inclined to be quizzical of the formalities of instruction. Dudley Moore with his clear speech and light tone seems to represent an excellent spokesperson that can present extensive information to children while avoiding a formal, didactic approach. 2 .Major Instructional Topics The content of the episodes, while focused primarily on depictions of animals in their natural habitats, contain important subtexts that are regularly repeated in many shows. These include examples of the vast variability of living species on different continents with indications of the fact that all sizes and shapes of birds, animals, and insects demonstrate remarkable means of adjusting to often extremely difficult ecological circumstances. While children are easily attracted to the big animals like elephants, lions, crocodiles, the series calls continuing attention to the remarkable constructive abilities and seeming social complexity of tiny meercat felines, beavers with their dam and lodge building, ants in their complex societies and especially the amazing termite towers, and the elegant mating rituals of bower birds. For the viewers in this age group, facing first exposures to a wider world outside of their own families, the series presents a key educational opportunity. Children can learn about the unusual kinds of animal home-building, of how various species gather food, or are predators who must also protect themselves or their young, or how many survive only by remarkable migrations. Because early school-age children are at the same time family-dependent, yet increasingly exposed to new settings, they sustain a strong interest in issues of childcare and safety. A recurrent feature throughout the series reflects issues of baby-care, and protection with examples of elephants to tortoises, from wallabies to koalas. There are many instances about the habits and pranks of primates and monkeys that not only delight children but also offer an easy opportunity for identification. At a more subtle level, there are continuing examples of animal life that may encourage children to think for the first time about critical issues of ecology and of the importance of preserving natural habitats for many species to survive in the face of widespread human incursions. The information about the beaver and the dam building of ponds stresses how this one animal contributes to the making an agreeable habitat for a variety of fish, fowl and insects. The critical importance for humans of preservation of tropical rainforest is well demonstrated in a manner easily grasped by this age group. Examples of humans as rescuers of endangered young animals are vividly presented. In Australia, the cute koala is often left homeless as the Eucalyptus trees that they depend on for food and shelter are cut down. Demonstrating how an orphaned, homeless koala is rescued by humans, nurtured, and then gradually returned to its habitat is a memorable example. Other comparable stories woven into episodes about baby pandas in China and even an orphaned black bear, nurtured by humans and then adopted by an unrelated mother are well presented. These vignettes appeal to the social and emotional feelings of the target viewers. These many instances also may convey a first exposure of children to the interdependence of humans and animals. The series offer a useful array of examples for children of how we can understand, respect, and appreciate the world of the other living organisms that share our planet without anthropomorphosis of other creatures. The episodes still show the natural ways in which we as humans can relate to the many other living species. The many examples of scientific research, of human rescue and care facilities for species such as eagles and wild horses, and the importance of natural habitat preservation all bring children a sense of fellowship with the animal world and greater understanding of nature. 3. Supplementary Learning Opportunities In addition to the major instructional thrusts of the series, there are some additional educational opportunities. Perhaps the most obvious is the area of expanded cognitive skills such as planning, problems solving, and, vocabulary. Unfamiliar words are explained by the host, and at times, supers on the screen help the viewer learn the names of animals or concepts such as migration, pouch. Other cognitive skills are enhanced by the use of maps or names of continents. Children become acquainted with how the sensory modalities of vision, smell, and hearing are used by animals to recognize their young as in the case of the zebra. Even the sonar-like sounds by bats and other nocturnal animals are exemplified. The uses of story segments within the episodes also are valuable for children, not only for sustaining interest but also as demonstration narrative thinking as a useful aid to memory. The baby wildebeest’s survival over several hundred miles of migration is a fine instance. Broken into segments but carefully preserving story-continuity, it helps children practice how to recognize sequences and refresh memories. At a more social level, the content of the many construction and childcare depictions demonstrates the value of cooperative behavior. The mother emu in Australia gives birth to eggs, but the father then sits on them, warming and guarding them, and oversees their hatching. The sharing of food and the nurturing of young in a great variety of animals, birds, aquaria, and insect species is powerfully demonstrated.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
