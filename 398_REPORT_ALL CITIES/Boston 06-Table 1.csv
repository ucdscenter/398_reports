It offers scientific content, scientific theories, the vocabulary and facts of science and the processes of scientific thinking. The scientific content of “Beakman’s World” overlaps with a significant number of the standards for science education that are prevalent in the curricula of today’s schools. In the physical science area for instance, Beakman both discussed and demonstrated the concepts of density and displacement with an experiment explaining why a steel boat floats while a steel bar sinks. In the life science area, Beakman explained the concept of migration and illustrated it with video of migrating birds, butterflies, caribou, salmon and grey whales. Throughout the series, Beakman conducts replicable experiments to illustrate the processes of investigation and experimentation. In addition to the scientific content of the episodes of “Beakman’s World,” it is also important to point out that the design of the series will appeal to the target age group. This age group represents the span from early adolescence through the teen-age years. These are years of transition for youngsters from late childhood to adulthood.

2006,WLVI-TV,CW NETWORK,Boston,4,Analog,STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE,core,Syndicated,Monday at 8am,13,0,30,3,6,"Strawberry Shortcake uses the highly popular, much loved characters who populate Strawberry Land to model prosocial beliefs and behaviors to young children. As Strawberry and her many friends explore the richly-imagined world of Strawberry they discover adventure, delight, fantasy, whimsy, humor, excitement, and music. And of course, they also encounter occasional problems. The interaction among Strawberry and her friends as they explore their world and deal with the problems inherent in their adventures offers a natural opportunity to present (as opposed to preach) pro-social beliefs, values, and behaviors. Strawberry Shortcake is a natural leader. She hosts the series and tells the stories. And most important, she is an ideal role model. Strawberry is curious, active, self-confident, and always willing to make her world a better place. She learns from her mistakes. No matter how hard she tumbles, she always picks herself up. Strawberry personifies the belief that hard-work, sacrifice, and caring will usually set things right. And just as important as Strawberry’s many positive qualities, she is surrounded by small circle of friends, most of whom share her values, but not necessarily her ability to take the broader view – to see beyond their own self-interest. As Strawberry helps them broaden their views, young viewers learn a wide array of positive values and actions. The themes underlying the stories that Strawberry Shortcake recounts in each episode are designed to have particular relevance for young viewers. Although they focus on “big” issues such as friendship, fear, self-confidence, sportsmanship, shyness, trust, love, they approach the themes in ways that are relevant to pre-school children. The stories focus on these issues in clear, concrete terms that are easily comprehended by young children. The pro-social messages flow naturally from the narrative. The characters experience concrete consequences for their actions – both good and bad – and the reasons for the consequences are clearly labeled. The stories are told in ways that make the messages clear, but not overbearing.",99,n/a,n/a,n/a

In their quest to become productive adults, the Littles and their friend Henry face the same kinds of problems that young children face every day - issues of friendship, jealousy, honesty, prejudice, consideration for others, kindness, responsibility, risk-taking... and more. Each episode of the Littles focuses on one such issue, presenting it in explicit, concrete terms. And young, attractive characters with whom children can identify carry out these actions, they serve as excellent role models for young viewers. Younger and older children, boys and girls, loners and social butterflies...all can find a character with whom to identify and from whom to learn. And last but far from least, the character of Grandpa, a wise, experienced, older Little who clearly loves and cares for the Little kids, functions as the kind of non-threatening, non-didactic teacher to whom children respond. He frequently articulates the lesson inherent in the action as he interacts with and advises the Little children. He is the best kind of teacher. The exciting adventures of the Littles and the suspense generated by their frequent narrow escapes from Dr Hunter are designed to capture and hold young viewers' attention.

On the surface, Krypto appears to be a normal, loyal, and fun-loving mutt. He is a playful companion to his young master, Kevin; and an integral member of a distinctive community of neighborhood pets. In this way, Krypto’s character and everyday life mirrors that of his original master, Superman’s, Clark Kent alter-ego. But just as with Superman, beneath Krypto’s ""mild mannered"" appearance lies an array of amazing powers, drive and heart. Superman taught a past generation the importance of using ones abilities effectively for just causes. Krypto does the same for today’s young viewers by acting as an engaging model for ethical actions, pro-social behaviors and heroic deeds. By incorporating this important learning goal in a context of fun and laughter, ""Krypto the Superdog"" also gives kids a chance to hone and develop their burgeoning sense of humor. In his ground-breaking studies, respected developmental psychologist, Anthony J. Chapman, found evidence that humor can be encouraged and taught through modeling. There is indication too that a sense of humor fulfills meaningful purposes for young children – helping them to cope with difficult and challenging situations, to understand language and to develop social skills.",99,n/a,n/a,n/a
