Dick is a former daredevil stuntman and Agent K is a British super-spy. Neither seems to know much about parenting, although their intentions are good. Agent K's highly intelligent automobile, C.A.R., her former spy partner, also joins the household. Their attempts to forge a family and adjust to a new school are both touching and comedic. Riley and Todd discover that they can call Fleemco to request replacement of any adult whom they dislike, who is overly strict, or who is merely uninteresting. The temporary Replacements for teachers, neighbors or other community figures never prove to be as exciting or fun as the siblings had hoped, and are often immature and obnoxious. As things go awry, Riley and Todd learn that they need adult leadership, discipline, role models, order and structure. By the end of each story they are eager to return the Replacement and reinstate the original adult. Stories revolve around issues such as cooperating with household/family rules, taking responsibility, fairness, building self-esteem, and trust.",1,N/A,3,N
