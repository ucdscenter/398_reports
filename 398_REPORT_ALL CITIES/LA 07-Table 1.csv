He lives with a peasant foster family and faces the intellectual, physical and social challenges that all teens face, while also preparing to rule justly and well. Sometimes Kuzco wonders whether being Emperor for the rest of his days will be a pleasure or a trap. Kuzco thwarts attempts by the nefarious Yzma and her henchman, Kronk, to stop him from doing well in school. If Kuzco were to fail at his class work, Yzma would become Empress. Kuzco struggles to complete his assignments and stay on track. Only if he remains steadfast, studies hard, learns from his mistakes, and can relate to citizens at all levels of society, will he ascend the throne. His best friend Malina, an excellent student, attempts to help Kuzco stay out of trouble and achieve his goals.

They find a comic book advertisement for Fleemco, an agency that will provide ""Replacement"" parents or adults to substitute for certain individuals. Brother and sister decide to send in the $1.98 fee in hopes of obtaining parents to replace their lost ones. They acquire an unorthodox pair of Replacement parents, Dick Daring and Agent K. Dick is a former daredevil stuntman and Agent K is a British super-spy. Neither seems to know much about parenting, although their intentions are good. Agent K's highly intelligent automobile, C.A.R., her former spy partner, also joins the household. Their attempts to forge a family and adjust to a new school are both touching and comedic. Riley and Todd discover that they can call Fleemco to request replacement of any adult whom they dislike, who is overly strict, or who is merely uninteresting. The temporary Replacements for teachers, neighbors or other community figures never prove to be as exciting or fun as the siblings had hoped, and are often immature and obnoxious. As things go awry, Riley and Todd learn that they need adult leadership, discipline, role models, order and structure. By the end of each story they are eager to return the Replacement and reinstate the original adult.

Miley wears blonde wigs while performing, and manages to escape being recognized. Miley's mother died three years before the story begins, so her dad is now a single parent. He has just begun dating again. Miley misses her mother very much. One of the songs that she writes and performs is about the pain of growing up without her mother. Unlike her brother, Miley is a dedicated student. At school, her enemies are Amber and Ashley, two girls who constantly bully Miley. Oliver and Lilly are fiercely protective of their friend. Miley has ordinary teenage insecurities, but remains true to herself, despite the allure of concert life, the limos, parties, and glamorous clothes. This is in no small part due to the solid values that her father, Miley's manager (Billy Rae Cyrus), has imparted.

The series addresses important age relevant topics in a direct and honest fashion. While adolescents will certainly have some awareness of issues presented, the series provides vivid representations of dilemmas along with solid information about how they can be handled. Many of these problems emerge from within the peer culture as well as occasionally from expectations and conflicts that adults may be experiencing. Resolutions emerge through peer discussions and direct experiences. Viewing these situations in the often entertaining and engrossing format of the series may also yield opportunities for teenagers to express any concerns they may have about their own choices and the consequences portrayed in each episode. The Degrassi series exemplifies topics such as bullying, cliques, dating, sexuality concerns, conflicts between friends, relationships with teachers and parents, substance abuse, and school pressures both intellectual and social. All of these problems reflect concerns youth may encounter in the sometimes tumultuous world of middle school and high school. The series also addresses the difficulties and opportunities for communication between adolescents and their parents and teachers. Often youth may have difficulty recognizing or expressing and confronting their own issues. Degrassi can act as a catalyst for young people who may be experiencing some of the problems presented on the show. Guides on the Internet are provided for the episodes to parents and teachers to talk with young people. The recurring casts of characters who appear in the episodes of Degrassi represent a diversity of personalities, ethnic backgrounds, body types and class distinctions affording the viewers opportunities for identification or modeling behaviors.
