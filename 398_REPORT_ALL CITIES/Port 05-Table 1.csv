One of the twins is polite and shy and excels in academics, while the other, an athlete and extrovert, barely scrapes by in school, due to disinterest and lack of effort, and instead often instigates wacky plans for outwitting hotel authorities, caregivers, and their mother. The boy's mother dates and would like to remarry. Their father is a professional rock musician who is on the road much of the year, but who stays in touch with his boys. This sets up occasional parental “conflicts” about discipline and expectations.

Each week Sabrina confronts her two sides and discovers that the magic of becoming human is even more demanding and more powerful than the magic of the Netherworld. As she struggles to understand and master her human side, Sabrina serves as an ideal role-model for the eight- to twelve-year-old audience. Sabrina is positive, self-reliant, competent...and open to new ideas. She listens, learns, and does what is necessary to reinforce the lesson for others. And with the help and guidance of her family and friends both Sabrina and the viewing audience come to understand what it takes to become a fully functioning, truly good human being. Attractive and engaging characters, entertaining story lines that mirror the kinds of issues and situations that concern children in middle childhood, and stories that flow from and examine those issues in concrete, explicit terms that children can understand.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
