In this series, Inspector Gadget (and the voice of Don Adams), one of children’s all-time favorite animated characters, leads 8 – 11-year-olds on field trips to some of the most interesting, exciting places in the world: London, China, the NASA Space Center, the Old West, and more. Combining animation with live-action footage, they are journeys filled with fascinating sights and exciting insights. We see how people live in other parts of the world (and sometimes in other historical eras). The shows reveal both differences and commonalities among various peoples, various cultures. Most trips contain some geography, some history, some science … and a whole lot of social science. Inspector Gadget’s Field Trips, produced in cooperation with the National Education Association (NEA), exposes young viewers to some of the most interesting geographical and historical sights in the world. It is designed not only to teach about the larger world in which today’s kids live, but more important, it is designed to engage their interest and stimulate their desire to learn more. By exposing young kids to the colorful facts, quirks, and interesting legends and lore associated with the places they visit, each episode is designed to spark viewers’ imagination – to excite them with the idea of finding out more about their world. In short, the goal of Inspector Gadget’s Field Trips is not only to teach kids about distant places, but to promote the belief that knowing about our complex world is both interesting and fun.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
2004,WBQC,UPN,Cincinnati,3,Analog,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS,Core,Syndicated,MT/7AM,26,0,30,3,6,"Mission. The Berenstain Bears uses the classic storybook series to present 3 – 6-year-olds prosocial messages about family, friends, and the problems and issues of early childhood. Need. It’s not easy being a young child. There is so much to discover, so much to see, and so many unanswered questions. How do I make friends? Why is it scary in the dark? Why does my imagination do those things? Can there really be too much of a good thing? What’s a poor winner? Why should I keep my room clean? Small wonder that parents often bemoan the dearth of models and examples that can help show young children how to navigate the new world they are exploring – and more important, how to navigate it maintaining strong values and an optimistic view of life. Surveys of what parents want for their children are remarkably consistent in the array of characteristics make up the top of the list: honesty, respect for others, perseverance, independence, respect for diversity, self-reliance and self confidence. Parents also frequently nominate such life skills as helping, sharing, literacy, good study habits, and getting along with others. And more often than not, parents complain that there are not enough models of these kinds of behavior portrayed in children’s television. “If we can use television to teach the alphabet,” they say, “Why can’t we use it to promote character development and positive life skills?” We think it can be done. And there is no better vehicle to reach young children than the tried and true classic series of storybooks that so many of us grew up with – The Berenstain Bears. Concept. A tiny hamlet in Bear Country, an extended family, wonderful whimsical friends, and a dastardly villain or two…this is the context for adventures, problems, and lessons about life and how to deal with numerous issues important to young children. The animated series brings to life the same characters and same child-relevant issues that many of us first encountered in Jan and Stan Berenstain’s wonderfully illustrated storybooks almost 50 years ago. Little is changed. Papa Q. Bear still has visions of grandeur. Brother, Sister, and Mama Bear still spend a lot of time keeping Papa out of trouble. The villainous Raffish Ralph and Weasel McGreed still attempt swindle after swindle. Professor Actual Factual still explores a wide array of interesting questions of the kind that kids love. And most important, the love and respect among Bear family members never wavers, the support of friends in the Bear community never falters, and no matter how bad the situation may seem, the Berenstain Bears always seem to do the right thing and come out wiser in the end. Throughout the action, Brother and Sister Bear, seven- and five-year-old cubs, serve as ideal models for young viewers. They ask the same questions and face the same problems as a typical young child. Just as your own five-year-old might be afraid of the dark, so too is Sister Bear – until Papa comes up with a way to make her more comfortable and to explain how it is better to control than be controlled by one’s imagination. Just as your own seven-year-old may have faced the disappointment of not having made the team, so too does Brother Bear. And his way of dealing with the disappointment by picking himself up and trying again presents a very important lesson in perseverance. Just as any child might get caught up in winning at any cost, so too does Papa Bear. And the consequences of his hyper-competitiveness provide an important lesson in moderation. The Berenstain Bears addresses problems and questions that are important to children from 3 – 6-year old. The love, warmth and respect that Mama and Papa Bear always demonstrate toward their children, the alert responsiveness of Brother and Sister Bear, and the clear portrayal of consequences for actions, all function to make The Berenstain Bears an excellent vehicle for promoting positive behavior among young children. Each half-hour episode presents two, eleven-minute segments. One directly addresses a specific child-oriented issue; the second generally promotes family, friendship, respect, and a sense that life can be fun and exciting. At the end of the day, when their adventures are done, the Bear Family goes home to Mama Bear’s wonderful cooking and Papa Bear’s philosophizing. It is the kind of home where they hear about the good old days from Gramps and Gran Bear, and bask in the knowledge that they are surrounded by love and that the world can be an exciting and wonderful place. It is this tone, this sense of fun, excitement, and security that makes The Berenstain Bears the kind of series simultaneously delights and informs audiences of all ages.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
2004,WBQC,UPN,Cincinnati,3,Analog,THE LITTLES,Core,Syndicated,WTH/7AM,26,0,30,5,9,"Mission: Promoting positive models of social behavior and character development while engaging and entertaining 5 – 9-year-olds. Concept and Approach: Imagine a community of creatures 4 inches tall – half-human, half-mouse. These are The Littles – and they may be living in the walls of your house. In most ways The Littles act and think like Bigs (some folks call them Humans), but their sense of wonder, their thirst for adventure, and their capacity for kindness sets them apart. This series focuses on one particular family of Littles – Grandpa (gruff, wise, and intent on sharing his wisdom with the younger Littles), Mom and Dad, Dinky (an irrepressible teen with a wild imagination who can be counted on to leap before he looks), and the two youngest: Tom and Lucy. They inhabit the walls of the home of 12-year-old Henry Big and his parents. Henry is the only Human who knows about the Littles; his archeologist parents who know that their boy sometimes acts a little strangely, and occasionally appears to talk to the walls, but don’t really know why. The only one who Henry’s suspects Henry’s secret is a sinister scientist named Hunter. He believes, but cannot prove, that the Littles exist, and strives to capture them to prove his theory. These elements provide the ingredients for constant adventure, constant surprise, and engaging prosocial lessons. In their quest to become productive adults, the Littles and their friend Henry face the same kinds of problems that young children face every day – issues of friendship, jealousy, honesty, prejudice, consideration for others, kindness, responsibility, risk-taking … and more. Each episode of the Littles focuses on one such issue, presenting it in explicit, concrete terms. And young, attractive characters with whom children can identify carry out these actions, they serve as excellent role models for young viewers. Younger and older children, boys and girls, loners and social butterflies…all can find a character with whom to identify and from whom to learn. And last but far from least, the character of Grandpa, a wise, experienced, older Little who clearly loves and cares for the Little kids, functions as the kind of non-threatening, non-didactic teacher to whom children respond. He frequently articulates the lesson inherent in the action as he interacts with and advises the Little children. He is the best kind of teacher. The exciting adventures of the Littles and the suspense generated by their frequent narrow escapes from Dr Hunter are designed to capture and hold young viewers’ attention. The explicitness with which each lesson is articulated and role models with whom children can identify are designed to ensure that children note and understand the embedded prosocial content as they derive delight from the action.",99,N/A,N/A,N/A
